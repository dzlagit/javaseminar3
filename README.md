### Exercise 1
Write a method with the function signature:

public static String getMonthName(int month);

The function should take a number between 1 and 12 and return a string giving the name of the month (use a switch statement).
You should use a Scanner in your main function to take input from a user (an integer value) and after calling the function you have defined your output should be similar to
Month number 4 is April.


### Exercise 2
This method should print the numbers between num1 and num2 with the specified numbers between lines. Numbers should be separated by exactly 1 space.

Write a test program ( use your main() function ) that prints 10 numbers per line from 1 to 100
